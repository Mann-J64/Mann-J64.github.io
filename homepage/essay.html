          <p>The last time I went to the Hall of Science, the entrance was lit enough to seem just a bit welcoming but still just a bit eerie at the same time. You go to the counter to see one employee at the counter, maybe two on good days. You pay for a pass to enter the Hall of Science; your journey of fun begins here. I remember trying to play with the Ferrofluid Machine, only to remember that it has been broken for... how long has it been anyways? Every time you try to remember, you can see it working as shown on the diagram on the side but you can’t quite put your finger on it. When was the last time it was working? It can't be that long ago, can it? It’s the same deal with the Mars Rover. Just hope one of the employees took the time to fix it. Or don’t hope, it’s not like any employee in the Hall of Science would do that. Now for the little aquarium robot replica. You sit down on a tiny stool, looking out of a very old, foggy window trying to grab “rocks'' with a tiny little claw. I remember there was a kid who poked his hand through the safety net that held the foam rocks in and he got to hold one.
            I’ll be honest, I'm not exactly sure why the Hall of Science became so important to me, it was a pretty mediocre museum if you could even call it that. I guess it was my stupid kid brain thinking everything was fun even though it really wasn't looking back on it. Looking back on your memories is fun but when someone asks you what made it fun, there are times where you'll pause for a moment. At first, you may feel some Museum of Natural History vibes until you go deeper beginning to see how all Teddy Rosevelt’s money from his will went into that museum and not this one. You can tell the Museum of Natural History is old but I’d argue it has aged pretty well. Not the Hall of Science, that place is old in both good and bad ways. I doubt they’ve fixed anything apart from the Mars Rover, and don’t you get me started on the surf simulation machine, that doesn’t work at all.
            It’s a bit of a mess, really. But that’s how the Hall of Science is. Even though the Hall of Science is in the state it’s in, I’d argue that both it and other places in New York are what make this state so special. I know that everyone’s had an experience, the specific fun that you can’t really put your finger on, it’s a New York experience for sure. You just can’t get it anywhere else, not in Florida, not in Maryland, not in Connecticut. Heck, not even Dubai or Indonesia. No matter where you go, you can never get the specific fun that New York has to offer, that’s the beauty of this odd, wacky state.</p>
